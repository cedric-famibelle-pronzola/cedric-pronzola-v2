# Free software will liberate us!

"**Free software will liberate us**."
This phrase should resonate in every corner of the planet. From **Silicon Valley** to **the Continent**, passing through **the last territories to be decolonized**. It is not a **pious wish** or an **incantation**, but a **certainty**.
To **liberate ourselves**, we must all become aware of **the importance of free software** and **the philosophy** that flows from it.

## What is software?

First, let's look at the definition of the word **software**.
I offer you the one from the [Oxford Dictionary](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/software):
"The programs, etc. used to operate a computer."

As an example, _Windows_ is an **operating system** (or operating software), not the best, perhaps even **the worst of all**, but it's the most widespread, notably thanks to aggressive lobbying, sprinkled with the corruptibility of traitors in suits.
_GNU/Linux_ is also among the operating systems, just like _macOS_.
_Microsoft Word_ is a **word processing software**, just like _Writer_ from the _LibreOffice_ suite.
_Chrome_, _Edge_, _Firefox_, _Brave_, and _Opera_ are also software. They are more commonly called **web browsers**.

## What is free software?

To define what **free software** is, let's use the largest collaborative online encyclopedia, itself built with **free software** [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:What_is_MediaWiki%3F) (_mediawiki.org_).
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) (_wikipedia.org_):
"Free software is computer software distributed under terms that allow users to run the software for any purpose as well as to study, change, and distribute it and any adapted versions."
You will understand, _Windows_, _macOS_, _Microsoft Word_, and _Chrome_ are not.
Indeed, even if we can use them, we cannot **study** or **modify** them (at least not legally).
In contrast, _GNU/Linux_, _LibreOffice_, and _Firefox_ check all the boxes.
That is, the latter **guarantee** the user the **four essential freedoms** that define **free software**:

1. Freedom to run the program
2. Freedom to study the source code of the program and modify it
3. Freedom to distribute copies
4. Freedom to distribute copies of a modified version

If software does not respect **even one** of these freedoms, it is not free. It is **proprietary software**.

## Social networks

This distinction between **free software** and **proprietary software** can also be made with **social networks**.
Very often, designers of proprietary software seek profitability. But how do you make a profit with free software?
It's simple, just sell users' personal data or add advertising. Both are possible.
Let's be clear, it's not about casting shame (not clean water) on developers or companies that make profits with their **programs** (you need to pay rent and eat). But in my opinion, software should at least be **ethical** and respect the **privacy** of its users.
Take the example of _Facebook_. Despite being free, there is a price to pay for the right to install and use it.
I allow myself three questions to illustrate my point:

* Do you really read the entire **TOS** (terms of service) before installing an application?
* Do you know the **permissions** (microphone, camera, files...) that you grant to applications when installing them?
* Have you ever seen an **advertisement** related to a **conversation** (not necessarily telephone) held a few minutes earlier, appear on _Instagram_ or _YouTube_?

If for the first two questions the answer is "no", we should not be surprised by a "yes" for the last one.
However, there are **free alternatives** to these applications. They respect privacy and guarantee individual freedoms. Even if they are **less used**, they are just as intuitive as their **proprietary** alter egos.
I'm talking about [_Mastodon_](https://joinmastodon.org/) _(joinmastodon.org)_ and [_PeerTube_](https://joinpeertube.org/) _(joinpeertube.org)_ among others. I will have the opportunity to come back to these in another article dealing with the **Fediverse.** But to simplify, _Mastodon_ is a free alternative to _X_ and _PeerTube_ a free alternative to _YouTube_.
 While waiting for the article linked to these solutions, here is a [very short video](https://runtube.re/w/g1KHLMn8fXqo8zp6pGRChW) (_runtube.re_) explaining what the **Fediverse** is.

## Let's summarize

On one side, we have software that is very often **paid** (free for some), of which we know nothing about how it works, which potentially siphons **our personal data** to better flood us with **targeted advertisements**.
On the other, we have software, **free** for the vast majority, which can be **dissected** in the smallest details, **modified** and **shared**, which **respects individual freedoms** and **privacy protection**.
The choice is quickly made, you might say, we should all choose **freedom**.
Yet, the overwhelming majority chooses the **prison** that is proprietary software, even when the free equivalent exists. This is explained by the general public's lack of awareness of free software.
The large groups that hold these **digital jails** count on our ignorance and the sorely lacking integrity of decision-makers to lock us in forever.

## Let's change our habits

Beyond the lack of awareness of free software, the core of the problem can be summed up in three words: **comfort zone**.
This place where we are comfortable, where we feel safe, is very pleasant. We would all like to stay there as long as possible, **without ever leaving**.
But this idyllic place makes us miss essential things, such as **knowledge** and **freedom**.
We should all take a tour outside our **comfort zone** from time to time, see what's happening there. Even if it means returning after each escapade. The only risks are acquiring **knowledge** and **freedom**.
I like to say that if **knowledge is a weapon**, **free software is a shield**.

We must gradually reduce our dependency on GAFAM (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft) and avoid using tools provided by firms that exploit our data to sell to the highest bidder. Let's not be afraid to step a little out of our **comfort zone** to **emancipate** ourselves. It's within everyone's reach. It just takes a good dose of will and a bit of time. No more, no less.
Our ignorance, the waste of our time in the meanders of algorithms, and our fear of change feed the GAFAM and will cause our downfall.
Even if the path seems rough and fraught with pitfalls, it is not. Moreover, it's a path to take to **emancipate**, to **free oneself**.

To begin the little escapade, here is a simple table of **proprietary software** and their **free equivalents**:

| Type                | Proprietary Software            | Free Software                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Office suite        | Microsoft Office                | [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) (_libreoffice.org_)                  |
| Browser             | Edge                            | [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) (_mozilla.org_)           |
| Media player        | Media Player (Microsoft)        | [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) (_videolan.org_)            |
| Email client        | Mail (Microsoft)                | [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/) (_thunderbird.net_)               |

The idea is not to throw yourself headlong into all these alternatives at once, that would be **time-consuming**.
Just become aware of their existence and **try them one by one** over a period you define. A week, two weeks, a month, it doesn't matter. The important thing is to try them regularly.
Some require a bit of time for learning or configuration (_LibreOffice_, _Thunderbird_), but others are very simple to use (_VLC_, _Firefox_).

As you venture outside your **comfort zone**, you will discover a vast catalog of **free software** suitable for **all your needs**.
To help you on your journey, the **Framasoft** association offers **the free directory**, **Framalibre** (_framalibre.org_).

## Savings for communities

Recently, alongside the fight against high costs of living initiated by the **RPPRAC** (_Rally for the Protection of Afro-Caribbean Peoples and Resources_), there has been talk of eliminating **the sea grant** in **the last French colonies**. This will significantly impact the budget of communities.
To compensate, the latter can make **savings** through **the transition to free software**.

Let's take three concrete examples:

* The city of **Rennes** has turned to free software to save money, as explained in the article by [Numerama](https://www.numerama.com/politique/290977-un-exemple-budgetaire-rennes-se-tourne-vers-le-logiciel-libre-pour-faire-des-economies.html) (_numerama.com_)
* The city of **Lyon** has abandoned _Microsoft_ "to move towards a general use of free software", according to [Tribune de Lyon](https://tribunedelyon.fr/economie/la-ville-de-lyon-abandonne-microsoft-pour-le-logiciel-libre/) (_tribunedelyon.fr_)
* [This article from La Gazette des Communes](https://www.lagazettedescommunes.com/854195/label-territoire-numerique-libre-les-collectivites-territoriales-passent-aux-logiciels-libres/) (_lagazettedescommunes.com_) explains that local authorities are switching to **free software**.

However, there is a counter-example.
It's the city of **Zurich**, in Switzerland. According to [Le Monde Informatique](https://www.lemondeinformatique.fr/actualites/lire-la-ville-de-munich-abandonne-officiellement-linux-pour-windows-67387.html) (_lemondeinformatique.fr_), it went the opposite way. That is, it abandoned _GNU/Linux_ for _Microsoft_.
But if we look at a detail at the end of the article, we learn that it was _Accenture_ that "recommended returning to Windows".
Nothing abnormal, you might say. A city hall asks for advice, a study is provided, then a decision is made. Except that by doing some research, we find that [Microsoft and Accenture are partners](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/services/microsoft-index) (_accenture.com_).
So the question of the impartiality of the "study requested by the Mayor" arises.

## Free software will liberate us

How will they liberate us? But above all, from what will they liberate us?

This article puts into perspective two diametrically opposed worlds.
On one side, we have the lure of profit, individualism, and opacity. On the other, solidarity, sharing, and transparency.
On one side, a closed world that is excessively financialized. On the other, a world of freedom and deeply human.

**Free software** will liberate us from the oligopolistic tyranny of the big tech groups, while paving the way for another world.
Indeed, we live at the rhythm of _GAFAM_ and **financial markets**. We feed them by using their **digital jails.** Without us, they don't exist, without them **we are free**.
It is essential to **seize our independence** from the colonial state, but it becomes just as necessary for us to free ourselves from capitalism by changing our consumption habits.
This applies to **food** as much as to **digital**.

Let's imagine a world in which the design of computer tools would be done with the preeminence of humans over capital.
A world of transparency, solidarity, a thousand leagues away from capitalism and its frantic race for wealth capture.
A world in which our individual freedoms would be respected and our privacy protected.
This world is possible, let's get out of our **comfort zone** and create this world **together**.
