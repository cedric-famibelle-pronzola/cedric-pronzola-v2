## Speech delivered on February 19, 2026, in Baku (Azerbaijan 🇦🇿) at the conference entitled **"Neocolonialism and Global Inequalities"**

Hello everyone, peace be upon you.

First, as is my habit, I thank Almighty God for allowing us to travel in very good conditions.

Next, I would like to thank the **Baku Initiative Group (GIB)**, its president **Abbas Abbasov**, as well as all the staff surrounding him. Thank you for the warm welcome, for the organization, and also for the logistics related to this event. Thank you to the media present and thank you to the public for making the trip as well.

So, despite what is indicated on the screen, I will address a different theme that was developed earlier. Namely, how have independence movements gained the upper hand over the colonial order? And I will take the liberty of adding: **how to overthrow this colonial order**.

## A Sham Independence

We all know here that the independences of the 1960s in Africa are sham independences.

The creation of the **AES**, the **Alliance of Sahel States**, shows us that the struggle for sovereignty, therefore for real independence, is underway and advancing by leaps and bounds. And this, despite the logistical and financial support from France to terrorist armed groups who kill and assassinate innocent people.

Regarding the last colonies, even if the independence movements have not yet overthrown the colonial order, we see that those who represent this colonial order are **panicking**. And they are panicking because they see and understand that they are losing their influence and power.

**This colonial order is living its final hours**, so it struggles and clings to everything it can, even if it means making mistakes, or even committing crimes.

## The Examples Are Numerous

In **Kanaky**, many have been shot down by agents of French colonialism. These agents could have been in uniform, but not only that—others were civilians who were supported by this illegitimate power.

In **Guadeloupe**, there was the so-called "big brothers" trial. In this fabricated case, innocent people were deported far from their homes, far from their families, because a prosecutor, **Patrick Desjardins**, who incidentally has been indicted for rape, abused his power to please his masters, just as cowardly as he is.

On the island of **La Réunion**, on the orders of the incompetents at the Élysée Palace surrounding President Macron, another prosecutor, named **Olivier Clémenson**, deemed it appropriate to traumatize my children by sending an elite police unit to intimidate me and silence me.

What they have not understood is that this kind of show of force **strengthens us in our struggle for the decolonization of La Réunion and the last French colonies**. And it makes us collectively **more determined than ever**.

## The Fear Has Changed Sides

This wind of panic that has reached the summit of the State shows one thing: **the fear has changed sides**.

On our side, we have:
- The **historical truth**
- **International law**
- Our partner, the **Baku Initiative Group (GIB)**
- And we have the **International Decolonization Front (FID)**

We clearly have the advantage, but let's not forget that many have sacrificed themselves so that we could have this advantage.

And I wish here to salute the courage of one man in particular, **Aniel Boyer**, from the **Parti Nation Rénioné**. He has paid a very high price for his commitment, he is still paying it today, so we would like to thank him for his fight.

And if my words reach him, we wish to assure him that **the succession is here**, conscious, informed, and determined.

With **Ka-Ubuntu**, we continue the struggle for the independence and sovereignty of the island of La Réunion.

## Three Objectives for Decolonization

Together, let us deliver the coup de grâce to this power that is hanging by a thread. **Let us overthrow this colonial order that is suffocating our peoples.**

We are united within the **International Decolonization Front (FID)** for this objective. Let us carry it out with rigor, and put an end to French colonialism.

I will conclude by addressing all peoples from territories under colonial domination.

**We must unite.**

Do not fear those in power. They are cowards. It is they who should fear us. And believe me, they fear us.

What they fear is that we unite to take back power from them. What they fear is that we are organized. But what they fear, above all, is that we come for them, so that they account for and answer for their crimes.

My brothers and sisters, we therefore have **three objectives**:

1. **Unite**
2. **Organize ourselves**
3. **Go after these thugs**

With the help of Almighty God, I promise you that we will fulfill these three objectives **by all necessary means**.

**Unite, organize ourselves, and go after these thugs.**

Thank you for your attention.
